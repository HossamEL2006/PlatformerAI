# Platformer AI

Welcome to the Platformer AI project! This is a collaborative learning initiative between [@HossamEL2006](https://github.com/HossamEL2006) and [@Lancelot65](https://github.com/Lancelot65) aimed at developing an advanced AI system for platformer games using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies).

## About the Project
Platformer AI is a hands-on project to explore and learn new technologies and concepts, including NEAT, Git, GitHub, image recognition, etc...
The goal is to create an AI capable of mastering platformer levels by evolving its neural network topology over time.

## Features
- **NEAT Integration**: Use NEAT to evolve AI agents for improved performance over time.
- **Image Recognition**: Implement basic image recognition to help AI navigate complex environments.
- **Learning-Oriented**: A project designed to help developers learn new skills and concepts.
- **Customizable AI Agents**: Create and train AI agents with evolving capabilities.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (pip install pygame)
- Numpy (pip install numpy)
- Pillow (pip install pillow)
